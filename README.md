__LED Infinity Pyramid__

Peripheral Leader: Thaddeus Morken  

__1.0	Introduction__

The purpose of our project is to create a LED lit infinity mirror in the form of a pyramid. The LEDs will be driven by various inputs through the HC9S12 microcontroller and the onboard peripherals.

We have proposed four modes for our LED outputs
•	Solid mode: Adjust red, green, blue, and white components of the LEDs though potentiometer inputs.
•	RGB fade mode: select RGB color like mode solid, then adjust the frequency control to change fade in/out speed. 
•	Color spectrum mode: LED strip cycles though color spectrum at a predetermined speed.
•	Audio mode: samples an audio input signal and outputs the treble, mid, and bass components to red, green, and blue outputs respectively.

For this project, Mark Oscai will be leading the team as team leader; he is in charge of team management, the design and implementation (interfacing) of the circuit that powers LEDs and MCU as well as building infinity mirrors pyramid. Thaddeus Morken is responsible for assisting in pyramid construction and designing an audio signal rectifier with filters. Andy Shi is the software leader and together with Jeff Heath will be in charge of the software design and interfacing; they will also be in charge of the project documentations and specifications.
