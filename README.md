__1.0	Introduction__

The purpose of our project is to create a LED lit infinity mirror in the form of a pyramid. The LEDs will be driven by various inputs through the HC9S12 microcontroller and the onboard peripherals.

We have proposed four modes for our LED outputs  
•	Solid mode: Adjust red, green, blue, and white components of the LEDs though potentiometer inputs.  
•	RGB fade mode: select RGB color like mode solid, then adjust the frequency control to change fade in/out speed.   
•	Color spectrum mode: LED strip cycles though color spectrum at a predetermined speed.  
•	Audio mode: samples an audio input signal and outputs the treble, mid, and bass components to red, green, and blue outputs respectively.
